Implementing Flow control on TI Stellaris MCUs.

The SAPI layer implements basic, interrupt based flowcontrol when used
with UARTs.  When used with USB and Ethernet, things are done with
ring buffers, and much of this doesn't apply.

Outgoing Flow Control:
FIFO Level is set at roughly one half.   The syscall detects that it
has crossed a FIFO boundary, and returns a different value so that the
Application can slow down the rate of output.  It also lowers the FIFO
threshhold so that the UART will wake the system from the WFI when the
FIFO has drained a bit.  When the IRQ fires, the interrupt handler
raises the thresh-hold and clears the IRQ so that Forth will fill up
the FIFO.

Incoming:
Use the timeout to detect single characters.  Set the FIFO thresshold
low.  When it fires, raise the level.  If its already high, Forth is
getting behind, so send an XOFF.  The getchar routine checks for flow
control, and sends the XON.
