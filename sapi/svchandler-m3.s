@ SVC Call trampoline.
@ All system calls have to take args from the 
@ Stack, so this code figures out which stack,
@ and passes it along to the routine as r0
@ We're now in supervisor mode, so r0-r4 are 
@ free for us to use as we see fit.
@
@ This is the core definition of whats basically a binary ABI
@ So this is as good a place as any to define it.
@ The tricky part is that the particulars of the ABI parameters are 
@ basically implementation defined.  More below.
@ This ABI was initially designed to support forth's character IO primitives:
@ getchar(), charsavail(), & putchar()
@ later it was extended to support string puts, and end-of-line. 
@ 
@ These cannot be direct substitutes for the forth words in question
@ because system calls are not allowed to block - the client
@ application must provide that functionality.

@ Incorporate register marshalling.   Thats a little wasteful
@ since all system calls don't need it, but it makes the code 
@ cleaner at the system call and it saves a little code at the 
@ function level.
@
@ It might appear on first inspection that you don't have to pull
@ the registers from the stack.   Thats true in most conditions.
@ Its very not true in one case:  Tail-chaining by the NVIC.  If the 
@ SVC handler tail-chains after another exception running at the same 
@ pre-emption priority level, R0-R3 & R12 will no longer be valid.
@ the only safe place to get the pushed registers under all circumstances
@ is the stack.

	@ bkpt #0

	@ Now that we have a copy of the original 
	@ stack pointer we can put more things on the stack.
	push { r4, lr }
	
	@ This is where you could make a copy of the stack frame pointer
	@ for system calls that need to access it - things like panic,
	@ reboot, etc that will pull the stacked PC, and so on.
